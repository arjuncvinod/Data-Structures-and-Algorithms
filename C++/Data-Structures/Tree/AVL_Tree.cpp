/*
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

Why AVL Trees?
Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete.. etc) take O(h) time where h is the height of the BST. 
The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary tree.
If we make sure that height of the tree remains O(Logn) after every insertion and deletion,
then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(Logn) for all these operations.

Insertion
To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every insertion, we must augment the standard BST insert operation to perform some re-balancing.
Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)).
1) Left Rotation
2) Right Rotation

Steps to follow for insertion
Let the newly inserted node be w
1) Perform standard BST insert for w.
2) Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path from w to z and
x be the grandchild of z that comes on the path from w to z.
3) Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. 
There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z 
can be arranged in 4 ways.
Following are the possible 4 arrangements:
a) y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
b) y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
c) y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
d) y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

Algorithm:-
1) Perform the normal BST insertion.
2) The current node must be one of the ancestors of the newly inserted node. Update the height of the current node.
3) Get the balance factor (left subtree height â€“ right subtree height) of the current node.
4) If balance factor is greater than 1, then the current node is unbalanced and we are either in Left Left case or left Right case. To check whether it is left left case or not, compare the newly inserted key with the key in left subtree root.
5) If balance factor is less than -1, then the current node is unbalanced and we are either in Right Right case or Right-Left case. To check whether it is Right Right case or not, compare the newly inserted key with the key in right subtree root.
