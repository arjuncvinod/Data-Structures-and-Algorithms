### Array
- [Move ALl Zeroes](move_all_zeroes_comment.cpp)

    Move_All_Zeros algorithm is the last to output if zero exists inside the array. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Move Neg To Left](Move-neg-to-left_comment.cpp)

    Move-Neg-To-Left algorithm is the algorithm that outputs first if negative numbers exist inside the array. It is not aligned with certain rules. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Positive at Even Negative at Odd](PositiveAtEvenNegativeAtOdd.cpp)

    The PositiveAtvenNagatveAtOdd algorithm outputs negative numbers at odd-numbered places and positive numbers at even-numbered places. After being classified as positive and negative, the first values are printed first, and if the positive and negative numbers are unbalanced, the remaining numbers are output in any order. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Remove Duplicates](Remove_duplicates_add_example.cpp)

    The Remove_duplicates algorithm removes only adjacent duplicate numbers. For example), if a value of 1,2,3,3,3,3,3 is entered, only 1,2,3 is output, but if a value of 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5, then 1,2,3,4,5 is output. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Rotate An Array](Rotate-an-array.cpp)

    The Rotate-an-array algorithm produces the first output of the value at the end of the array. For example, if the value '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10' is added, '10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9' is output. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Sort 012](sort012.cpp)

    sort 012 algorithm is ordered by input with values of 0, 1 and 2.
    index 0 - (low - 1) present all the 0s
    index low - (mid - 1) present all the 1s
    index high - (n-1) present all the 2s
    For example, if the initial value is 0 1 2 1 2 0 1, the result value is 0 0 1 1 2 2. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Sum of two Arrays](Sum_of_two_arrays_comment.cpp)

    The Sum_of_two_arrays algorithm simply considers the value in the array to be the number of digits and adds the value. For example, if the input is 1 5, 2, 1 and 3, the output is 152+13, so it is 165. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [Three Sum](threeSum.cpp)

    The threeSum algorithm looks for all three unique pairs of zero totals in the array when you specify n integers for the array number. 
    
    Time complexity = O(n*2log n)
