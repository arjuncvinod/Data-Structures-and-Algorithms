### Trie
- [Trie](Trie.cpp)

Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree which is an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.  Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit(key length).

Time complexity = O(M)
