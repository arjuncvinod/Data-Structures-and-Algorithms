- [Painter's Partition Problem](painter%E2%80%99s%20partition%20problem.cpp)
    
    Painter's Partition Problem is to find the minimum time when we have to paint n boards of length {A1,A2,....,An} and there are k painters available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards like board {2,3,4} or only board {1}, or nothing but not board {2,4,5}	
    
    Time complexity = O(k*N^3)

- [Tower of Hanoi1](tower_of_hanoi.cpp), [Tower of Hanoi2](TowerOfHanoi.cpp)
    
    Tower of Hanoi is a mathematic puzzle which consists of three towers and more than one rings. There are three rules in this algorithm in moving all the disks to some another tower without violationg the sequence of arrangement. 1. Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time 2. Only the top disk can be removed 3. No large disk can sit over a small disk	
    
    Time complexity = O(n)
