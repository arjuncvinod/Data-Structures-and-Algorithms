### Backtracking-Algorithms
- [CROSSWARD](CROSSWARD.cpp)
    
    Using Crossward Algorithm, user inputs 10 words

    Timing complexity = O(k)

- [Permutation of String](Permutation_of_string.cpp)
    
    Premutation of string is a algorithm that functions to find all possible permutations of a given string, for example if there are given string "ABC" then ABC,ACB,BAC,BCA,CBA,CAB is the result

    Time complexity = O(n^2*n!)

- [RAT IN MAZE](RAT_IN_MAZE_problem.cpp)
    
    RAT IN MAZE is a algorithm to find all possible path in maze to escape using backtracking
    
    Time complexity = O(2^(n^2))

- [Subsets](Subsets.cpp)

    Subset is a alogrithm for a given set of positive integers that functions to find all its subset

    Time complexity = O(2^n)

- [SudokuSolver](sudokuSolver.cpp)
    
    SudokuSolver is a algorithm to solve sudoku which starts with some cells containing numbers, and the goal is to solve the remaining cells
    
    Time complexity = O(9^(n*n))

- [NQueens](nqueens.cpp)
    
    NQueens is a alogrithm when there is an arrangement of N queens on a N*N chess board, find out the number of N queens in which they do not collide with each other
    
    Time complexity = O(2^n)

- [Word Break Problem](word_break_problem.cpp)
    
    Word_Break_Problem is a algorithm when there is a valid sentence without any spaces between the words and a dictionary of valid English words, find all possible ways to break the sentence in individual dictionary words. For example when there is a example like "ilikeicecreamandmango" outputs will be "i like ice cream and mango", "i like ice cream and mango" if the dictionary were {i,like, ice, cream, and, icecream, mango}	
    
    Time complexity = O(2^(n*s)) (since we approach using recursive)
