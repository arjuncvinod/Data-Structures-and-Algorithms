//Problem statement: Kosaraju's algorithm for a strongly connected component
//Explaination: A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.

//Input: Graph

//Output: Number of strongly connected components

/* SOLUTION APPROACH:
- Create an empty stack. Do a DFS for every vertex and push the vertex into the stack after all its adjacent vertices have been visited
- Obtain the transpose of the original graph by reversing the direction of all edges
- Pop the vertices from the stack and do a DFS on them. The number of DFSs will give the solution

Why this works:
- The above algorithm is DFS based. It does DFS two times. DFS of a graph produces a single tree if all vertices are reachable from the DFS starting point. Otherwise DFS produces a forest. So DFS of a graph with only one SCC always produces a tree. The important point to note is DFS may produce a tree or a forest when there are more than one SCCs depending upon the chosen starting point.
- if we do a DFS of graph and store vertices according to their finish times, we make sure that the finish time of a vertex that connects to other SCCs (other that its own SCC), will always be greater than finish time of vertices in the other SCC. That is why we are using the stack
- So if we do a DFS of the reversed graph using sequence of vertices in stack, we process vertices from sink to source (in reversed graph). That is what we wanted to achieve and that is all needed to print SCCs one by one
