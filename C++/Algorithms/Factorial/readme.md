### Factorial
- [FactRecursion](factRecursion.cpp)
    
    FactRecursion, which is a program for factorial of a number. Factorial of a non-negative integer, is multiplication of all integers smaller than or equal to n. For example, we can think of factorial 5 is = 5x4x3x2x1 = 120
    
    Time complexity = O(n)

- [FactUsual](factUsual.cpp)
    
    FactUsual, which is a same problem above(which is factorial recursion), but calculating factorial of a number in an iterative way.

    Time complexity = O(n)
